# React-questions

# 1.What is React.js?

```
  
React.js is declarative
React.js is simple
React.js is component based
React.js supports server side
React.js is extensive
React.js is fast 
React.js is easy to learn 
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right           components when your data changes.

# 2. Why would you use React.js?



```      
 Simplicity
 Developers love it
 Reusable elements
 Easy to update components, individually or in bulk
 Virtual DOM
 React Native and Mobile Apps

# 3. What are components?


```

Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Class components.

# 4. What ia JSX?


```
JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.
JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code.
By using JSX you can write HTML-like structures in the same file as you write JavaScript code.
It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.
It makes it easier for us to create templates.
Instead of separating the markup and logic in separated files, React uses components for this purpose. We will learn about components in detail in further articles.
JSX is basically a syntax extension of regular JavaScript and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the React DOM

# 5. What are props?


```

Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. React’s data flow between components is uni-directional (from parent to child only).
React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes.
Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.
Props  are immutable.  The React philosophy is that props should not change, parent components can send prop values to child components but the child cannot modify its own props. Components that use only props will always render the same output when given the same input and this makes them easier to test.

# 6. What is State?


```

State is a JavaScript object that stores component’s dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders.state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity .
State is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change.
State is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component

# 7. What are React Hooks?


```

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
React Hooks are functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle features from function components
Hooks allow us to easily manipulate the state of our functional component without needing to convert them into class components
Hooks let you use the functions instead of switching between HOCs, Classes, and functions.
